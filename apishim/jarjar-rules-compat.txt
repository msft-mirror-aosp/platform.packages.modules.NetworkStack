# jarjar rules to use on API stable builds.
# Use the latest stable apishim package as the main apishim package, to replace and avoid building
# the unstable, non-compatibility shims.
# Once API 30 is stable, apishim/30/com.android.networkstack.apishim should be moved to the
# com.android.networkstack.apishim.api30 package, a new apishim/31/com.android.networkstack.apishim
# package should be created, and this rule should reference api30.
